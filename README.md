Infrastructure

This is the infrastructure with AWS codepipeline, codebuild, lambda, and all dependencies to run a CI/CD platform for my [resume](https://github.com/aliciousness/resume).

- CERTS AND CONNECTION MUST BE VALIDATED IN THE CONSOLE BEFORE CREATING OTHER RESOURCES IN [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). \*

after certificates issued and connection available run -pulumi refresh- to refresh pulumi stack resources and output values. Then run -pulumi up- again.
